Restatements of information from previous reporting periods can correct an error, or account for changes in measurement methodology or to the nature of the business. Restatements of information ensure consistency and enable comparability of information between reporting periods. See the Comparability principle in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information.\r\n\r\nThe organization should report the criteria used to determine when a change or error in previously reported information is considered significant enough to provide a restatement. A change or error could be significant when it influences information users’ decision-making (e.g.,it influences the analysis of the changes in the organization’s impacts over time).\r\n\r\nFor example, if an organization adopts a new, more accurate method for measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it may subsequently experience a reduction in its previously reported GHG emissions that meets the organization’s restatement criteria. The organization then restates its previously reported GHG emissions. In such a case, the organization is required to explain that it has restated its previously reported GHG emissions due to the new measurement methodology and that this has resulted in lower GHG emissions than previously reported. The  organization should also report the quantitative change observed (e.g., GHG emissions are 10%\r\nlower than the emissions previously reported).\r\nIf the organization has not made any restatement in the reporting period, a brief statement of this fact is sufficient to comply with the requirement.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-4-a-i\r\nExamples of reasons for restatements of information include:\r\n• change of base period or length of the reporting period;\r\n• change in the nature of the business;\r\n• change in the measurement methodologies or in the definitions used;\r\n• disposals, mergers, or acquisitions;\r\n• error made in previous reporting periods.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-4-a-ii\r\nThe effect of the restatement refers to the consequences of the change or correction made to previously reported information. If the restatement relates to quantitative information, the organization should specify the quantitative change in the restated information (e.g., GHG emissions are 10% lower compared to the level of emissions previously reported)."

Instead, it can provide a high-level overview of its value chain.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-6-b-i\r\nWhen describing its activities, the organization should report its total number of operations and explain how it defines ‘operation’.\r\nWhen describing its products and services, the organization should report:\r\n• the quantity of products or services provided during the reporting period (e.g., number of products or services provided, net sales of products or services provided);\r\n• whether it sells products or services that are banned in certain markets or are the subject of  stakeholder concerns or public debate, including the reason for the ban or concerns and how the organization has responded to these concerns.\r\n\r\nWhen describing the markets served, the organization can report:\r\n• the geographic locations where products and services are offered;\r\n• the demographic or other characteristics of the markets;\r\n• information on the size and relative importance of the markets (e.g., net sales, net revenues).\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-6-b-ii\r\nThe organization can describe:\r\n• the types of suppliers (e.g., brokers, contractors, wholesalers); \r\n• the estimated number of suppliers throughout its supply chain and in each tier (e.g., first tier,second tier);\r\n•the types of activities related to the organization’s products and services carried out by its suppliers (e.g., manufacturing, providing consulting services);\r\n• the nature of its business relationships with its suppliers (e.g., long-term or short-term, contractual or non-contractual, project-based or event-based);\r\n• the sector-specific characteristics of its supply chain (e.g., labor-intensive);\r\n• the estimated monetary value of payments made to its suppliers;\r\n• the geographic location of its suppliers.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-6-b-iii\r\nThe organization can describe:\r\n• the types of downstream entities (e.g., customers, beneficiaries);\r\n• the estimated number of downstream entities;\r\n•the types of activities related to the organization’s products and services carried out by the downstream entities (e.g., manufacturing, wholesale, retail);\r\n•the nature of its business relationships with the downstream entities (e.g., long-term or short-term, contractual or non-contractual, project-based or event-based);\r\n• the geographic location of the downstream entities.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-6-c\r\nOther relevant business relationships include relationships that the organization has with entities that are not described as part of its value chain under 2-6-b. These may include business partners (e.g., joint ventures) and other entities directly linked to the organization’s operations, products, or services (for examples, see the note in the definition of ‘business relationships’).\r\nThe organization can report the types of entities, their activities, and their geographic location.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-6-d\r\nRequirement 2-6-d entails describing significant changes in the organization’s sectors, value chain, and other business relationships compared to the previous reporting period. This information can help explain changes to the organization’s impacts. Examples of significant changes that can be reported under this disclosure are changes in activities such as the opening, closing, or expansion of facilities; changes in the structure of the organization’s supply chain or in its relationships with suppliers, including selection and termination; or changes in the location of its suppliers."

                  "answer": "Together with Disclosure 2-8, this disclosure gives insight into the organization’s approach to employment, including the scope and nature of impacts arising from its employment practices. It also provides contextual information that aids an understanding of the information reported in other disclosures, and serves as the basis for calculation in other disclosures, such as Disclosure 2-21 Annual total compensation ratio and Disclosure 2-30 Collective bargaining agreements in this Standard.\r\n\r\nThis disclosure covers all employees who perform work for any of the organization’s entities included in its sustainability reporting as reported under Disclosure 2-2 in this Standard.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-7-a\r\nAn employee is an individual who is in an employment relationship with the organization according to national law or practice.\r\n\r\nProviding a breakdown of employees by gender gives insight into gender representation across the organization. Providing a breakdown of employees by region gives insight into regional variations. A region can refer to a country or other geographic locations, such as a city or a world region.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-7-b\r\nThe definitions of permanent, temporary, non-guaranteed hours, full-time, and part-time employees differ between countries. If the organization has employees in more than one country, it should use the definitions as per the national laws of the countries where the employees are based to calculate country-level data. The country-level data should then be added up to calculate total numbers, disregarding differences in national legal definitions.\r\nNon-guaranteed hours employees are employed by the organization without a guarantee of a minimum or fixed number of working hours. The employee may need to make themselves available for work as required, but the organization is not contractually obligated to offer the employee a minimum or fixed number of working hours per day, week, or month. Casual employees, employees with zero-hour contracts, and on-call employees are examples that fall under this category. If the organization is unable to report exact figures, it can report estimates of the number of employees to the nearest ten or, where the number of employees is greater than 1,000, to the\r\nnearest 100, and explain this under 2-7-c.  See Table 1 and Table 2 of this Standard for examples of how to present this information.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-7-c\r\nThe organization can report the total number of employees and the number of permanent, temporary, non-guaranteed hours, full-time, and part-time employees in head count or full-time equivalent (FTE). Reporting these numbers in head count gives insight into the number of individual employees, whether full-time or part-time employed. Reporting these numbers in FTE gives insight into the hours worked. The organization can use another methodology for reporting these numbers.Reporting the number of employees at the end of the reporting period provides information for that point in time, without capturing fluctuations during the reporting period. Reporting these numbers in averages across the reporting period takes into account fluctuations during the reporting period.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-7-d\r\nQuantitative data, such as the number of temporary or part-time employees, is unlikely to be sufficient on its own. For example, a high proportion of temporary or part-time employees could indicate lack of employment security for employees, but it could equally signal workplace flexibility when offered as a voluntary choice. For this reason, the organization is required to report contextual information to help information users interpret the data.\r\nThe organization can explain the reasons for temporary employment. An example of such a reason is the recruitment of employees to undertake work on a temporary or seasonal project or event. Another example is the standard practice to offer a temporary contract (e.g., six months) to new employees before an offer of permanent employment is made. The organization can also explain the reasons for non-guaranteed hours employment.\r\nThe organization can explain how it defines full-time employment. If the organization has employees in more than one country, it can report the definitions of full-time employment it uses for the regions that cover these countries. The organization can also explain the reasons for part-time employment. Examples of such reasons are to accommodate employees’ requests to work reduced hours, or because the organization is unable to provide full-time employment to all employees.\r\n\r\nIf there are differences in permanent, temporary, non-guaranteed hours, full-time, and part-time employment between genders or between regions, the organization can explain the reasons for these differences.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-7-e\r\nRequirement 2-7-e enables the organization to explain how the numbers of employees vary during the reporting period compared to the previous reporting periods (i.e., whether the numbers have increased or decreased). It can also include the reasons for the fluctuations. For  example, an increase in the number of employees during the reporting period could be due to a seasonal event. Conversely, a decrease in the number of employees compared to the previous reporting period could be due to the completion of a temporary project.\r\n\r\nIt is up to the organization to determine which fluctuations in the number of employees it considers significant to report under 2-7-e. The organization should report its threshold for determining significant fluctuations.\r\n\r\nIf there are no significant fluctuations in the number of employees during the reporting period or between reporting periods, a brief statement of this fact is sufficient to comply with the requirement.\r\nhttps://www.globalreporting.org/pdf.ashx?id=12358 "

                  "answer": "This disclosure provides an understanding of how much the organization relies on workers who are not employees to perform its work, in comparison to employees. This information is important for understanding how many workers in total perform work for the organization, because workers who are not employees are not represented in employment figures reported under Disclosure 2-7.\r\n\r\nDisclosure 2-8, together with Disclosure 2-7, gives insight into the organization’s approach to employment, as well as the scope and nature of impacts arising from its employment practices. It also provides contextual information that aids an understanding of the information reported in other disclosures.\r\n\r\nThis disclosure covers all workers who are not employees and whose work is controlled by any of the organization’s entities included in its sustainability reporting as reported under Disclosure 2-2 in this Standard.\r\nIf all the workers performing work for the organization are employees and the organization does not have any workers who are not employees, a brief statement of this fact is sufficient to comply with the requirements under this disclosure.\r\nSee references [7], [19], [22], [23], [24], [26], and [30] in the Bibliography.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-8-a\r\nWorkers who are not employees are those who perform work for the organization but are not in an employment relationship with the organization. This disclosure requires the organization to report the number of workers who are not employees and whose work is controlled by the organization. Control of work implies that the organization directs the work performed or has control over the means or methods for performing the work.\r\nThe organization might have sole control of the work or share control with one or more organizations (e.g., suppliers, customers, or other business partners, such as in joint ventures). Types of workers who are not employees and whose work is controlled by the organization include agency workers, apprentices, contractors, home workers, interns, self-employed persons, sub-contractors, and volunteers. The organization should report how it has determined when it has control of the work for workers who are not employees.\r\n\r\nThe following are examples of workers who are not employees and whose work is controlled by the organization. The following workers are included under this disclosure:\r\n• Contractors hired by the organization to perform work at the organization’s workplace, in a public area (e.g., on a road), or directly at the workplace of the organization’s client.\r\n• Workers of one of the organization’s suppliers, where the organization instructs the supplier to use particular materials or work methods to manufacture the products or deliver the servivces\r\n\r\nThe following are examples of workers who are not employees and whose work is not controlled by the organization. The following workers are not included under this disclosure:\r\n•Workers of an equipment supplier to the organization who perform regular maintenance on the supplier’s equipment (e.g., photocopy machines at the organization’s workplace) as stipulated in the contract between the equipment supplier and the organization.\r\n• Workers of one of the organization’s suppliers, if the organization sources standard products manufactured using the supplier’s production methods (e.g., purchasing stationery that is a standard product of the supplier).\r\nIf the organization cannot report exact figures, it can report estimates of the number of workers  who are not employees to the nearest ten or, where the number of workers who are not employees is greater than 1,000, to the nearest 100, and explain this under 2-8-b.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-8-a-i and 2-8-a-ii\r\nWhen reporting its contractual relationship with the most common types of workers, the organization should report whether it engages them directly or indirectly through a third party, and in the latter case, who this third party is (e.g., employment agency, contractor). It is sufficient that the organization provides a general description. The organization is not required to report the type of worker, contractual relationship, and work performed for every\r\nworker who is not an employee.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-8-b\r\nThe organization can report the number of workers who are not employees in head count or fulltime equivalent (FTE). The head count gives insight into the number of individual workers, whether on a full-time or part-time basis. The FTE gives insight into the hours worked. The organization can use another methodology for reporting this number. Reporting the number of workers who are not employees at the end of the reporting period provides information for that point in time without capturing fluctuations during the reporting period. Reporting this number as an average across the reporting period takes into account  fluctuations during the reporting period.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-8-c\r\nRequirement 2-8-c enables the organization to explain how the number of workers who are not employees varies during the reporting period or compared to previous reporting periods (i.e., whether the numbers have increased or decreased). It can also include the reasons for the fluctuations. For example, an increase in the number of workers who are not employees during the reporting period could be due to a seasonal event. Conversely, a decrease in the number of workers who are not employees compared to the previous reporting period could be due to the completion of a temporary project.\r\n\r\nIt is up to the organization to determine which fluctuations in the number of workers it considers significant to report under 2-8-c. The organization should report its threshold for determining significant fluctuations.\r\nIf there are no significant fluctuations in the number of workers who are not employees during the reporting period or between reporting periods, a brief statement of this fact is sufficient to comply with the requirement."

Annual total compensation includes salary, bonus, stock awards, option awards, non-equity incentive plan compensation, change in pension value, and nonqualified deferred compensation earnings provided over the course of a year. When calculating the ratio, the organization should, depending on the organization’s remuneration policies and availability of\r\ndata, consider all of the following: \r\n• Base salary, which is the sum of guaranteed, short-term, and non-variable cash compensation.\r\n• Total cash compensation, which is the sum of the base salary and cash allowances, bonuses, commissions, cash profit-sharing, and other forms of variable cash payments.\r\n• Direct compensation, which is the sum of total cash compensation and total fair value of all annual long-term incentives (e.g., stock option awards, restricted stock shares or units, performance stock shares or units, phantom stock shares, stock appreciation rights, and long-term cash awards).\r\nThe annual total compensation ratio can be calculated using the following formula= (Annual total compensation for the organization's highest paid-individual/Median annual total compensation for all of the organization's employees excluding the highest-paid individual)\r\nThe change in the annual total compensation ratio can be calculated using the following formula= (Percentage increase in annual total compensation for the organization's highest-paid individual/ Percentage increase in annual total compensation for the organization's highest-paid individual)\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-21-c\r\nQuantitative data, such as the annual total compensation ratio, may not be sufficient on its own to understand pay disparity and its drivers. For example, pay ratios can be influenced by the size of the organization (e.g., revenue, number of employees), its sector, its employment strategy (e.g., reliance on outsourced workers or part-time employees, a high degree of automation), or currency volatility. The difference in pay disparity reported over the years may be the result of a change in the organization’s compensation policy or the level of compensation for its highest-paid individual or employees, a change in calculation methodology (e.g., selection of the median annual total\r\ncompensation, inclusions or exclusions) or an improvement in data collection processes. For this reason, the organization is required to report contextual information to help information users interpret the data and understand how it has been compiled.\r\nThe organization should provide the following contextual information:\r\n• Whether any employees reported under Disclosure 2-7 in this Standard have been excluded.\r\n• Whether full-time equivalent (FTE) pay rates are used for each part-time employee.\r\n• A list of the types of compensation included.\r\n• The title of the highest-paid individual.\r\n\r\n"

                  "question": "Guidance",
                  "answer": "This disclosure covers the organization’s policy commitments for responsible business conduct, including the commitment to respect human rights. These commitments can be set out in a stand-alone policy document or be included within one or more other policy documents, such as codes of conduct.\r\n\r\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises [12], the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct [11], and the United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights [14] set out expectations for organizations in relation to these policy commitments.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-23-a\r\nThe organization should report the expectations, values, principles, and norms of behavior setout in the policy commitments.\r\n\r\nThe organization can also report how the policy commitments were developed, including the internal and external expertise that informed the policy commitments.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-23-a-i\r\nSee the Bibliography for a list of authoritative intergovernmental instruments for responsible business conduct. The organization can also make a reference to other standards or initiatives that it participates in.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-23-a-iii\r\nThe precautionary principle is set out in Principle 15 of the UN Rio Declaration on Environment and Development [18]. It states: ‘Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.’ The precautionary principle means taking early action to prevent and mitigate potential negative impacts in situations where conclusive scientific understanding or evidence is lacking, but there is sufficient reason to expect serious or irreversible damage. While the precautionary principle is most often associated with the protection of the\r\nenvironment, it can be applied to other areas, such as health and safety. The organization can describe the areas where it applies the precautionary principle.\r\n\r\nThe application of the precautionary principle can be reported under 3-3-d-i in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021, as part of the organization’s actions to prevent or mitigate potential negative impacts for each material topic.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-23-b-i\r\nHuman rights are rights inherent to all human beings and are all interrelated, interdependent, and indivisible. The internationally recognized human rights include, at a minimum, the rights set out in the UN International Bill of Human Rights [15] and the principles concerning fundamental rights set out in the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work [5]. The UN International Bill of Human Rights consists of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its two Optional Protocols.\r\n\r\nOther UN instruments elaborate further on the rights of indigenous peoples; women; national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities; children; persons with disabilities; and migrant workers and their families. There are also standards of international humanitarian law that apply in situations of armed conflict, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) Geneva Conventions of 1949 [1]. At the regional level, binding treaties as well as non-binding instruments provide region-specific frameworks for human rights.\r\n \r\nIf the policy commitment covers all internationally recognized human rights, a brief statement of this fact is sufficient to comply with the requirement. The organization can also state if the policy commitment references certain rights that require particular attention. For example, an organization can state that its policy commitment covers all internationally recognized human rights, and also references the rights to privacy and freedom of expression in particular because the organization has identified that its activities have an impact on these rights.\r\n\r\nIf the policy commitment covers only some internationally recognized human rights, the organization is required to state the rights that are covered. It can explain why the policy commitment is limited to these rights.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-23-b-ii\r\nCategories of stakeholders that the organization gives particular attention to can include consumers, customers, employees and other workers, and local communities. They can also include individuals belonging to groups or populations that are considered to be at risk or vulnerable groups, such as children; human rights defenders; indigenous peoples; migrant workers and their families; national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities; persons who might be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics; persons with disabilities; or women. For example, a bank may give particular attention in its policy commitment to avoid discriminating against specific categories of customers, or a mining organization may give particular attention to avoid infringing on the rights of indigenous peoples.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-23-d\r\nThe most senior level may differ between organizations. For example, the most senior level in an organization could be the highest governance body (e.g., the board) or the most seniorexecutive (e.g., chief executive officer).\r\nThe organization can also report the dates of approval and adoption of the policy commitments, and how frequently the commitments are reviewed.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-23-e\r\nIf the policy commitments apply to all of the organization’s activities and business relationships equally, a brief statement of this fact is sufficient to comply with the requirement. If the policy commitments apply to only some of the organization’s activities (e.g., they apply only to entities located in certain countries or to certain subsidiaries), the organization should report which activities the commitments apply to. It can also explain why the commitments are limited to these activities.\r\n\r\nIf the policy commitments apply to only some of the organization’s business relationships, the organization should specify the types of business relationships the commitments apply to (e.g., distributors, franchisees, joint ventures, suppliers). It can also explain why the commitments are limited to these business relationships. The organization should also explain whether the business relationships are obligated to abide by the policy commitments or are encouraged(but not obligated) to do so.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-23-f\r\nThe organization can report:\r\n• whether the policy commitments need to be read, agreed to, and regularly signed by all workers, business partners, and other relevant parties, such as governance body members;\r\n• the means through which it communicates the policy commitments (e.g., newsletters, formal or informal meetings, dedicated websites, contractual agreements);\r\n• how it identifies and removes potential barriers to the communication or dissemination of the policy commitments (e.g., by making them accessible and available in relevant languages).\r\n\r\n"

                  "answer": "This disclosure covers grievance mechanisms that the organization has established or participates in. Grievance mechanisms enable stakeholders to raise concerns about, and seek remedy for, the organization’s potential and actual negative impacts on them. This includes impacts on their human rights. This disclosure also covers other processes by whichthe organization provides for or cooperates in the remediation of negative impacts that it\r\nidentifies it has caused or contributed to.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights [14] and   the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises [12] set out expectations for organizations to provide for or cooperate in the remediation, through legitimate processes, of negative impacts that they identify they have caused or contributed to. The organization is not responsible for the remediation of negative impacts directly linked to its operations, products, or services by its business relationships, where the organization has not contributed to the impacts. It can, however, play a role in the remediation. See Box 3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 for more information on causing, contributing, or being directly linked to negative impacts.\r\n\r\nThese instruments also set out expectations for organizations to establish or participate in effective operational-level grievance mechanisms. Grievance mechanisms are distinct from whistleblowing mechanisms. Whistleblowing mechanisms enable individuals to raise concerns about wrongdoing or breaches of the law in the organization’s operations or business relationships, regardless of whether the individuals\r\nthemselves are harmed or not. Whistleblowing mechanisms are reported under Disclosure 2- 26 in this Standard.\r\n\r\nThis disclosure covers the operation of grievance mechanisms and other remediation processes. The actions taken to provide for or cooperate in the remediation of actual negative impacts for material topics are reported under 3-3-d-ii in GRI 3. \r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-25-b\r\nGrievance mechanisms refer to any routinized, state-based or non-state-based, judicial or nonjudicial processes through which stakeholders can raise grievances and seek remedy.Examples of state-based judicial and non-judicial grievance mechanisms include courts (for both criminal and civil actions), labor tribunals, national human rights institutions, National Contact Points under the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, ombudsperson offices, consumer protection agencies, regulatory oversight bodies, and government-run complaints offices.\r\n\r\nNon-state-based grievance mechanisms include those administered by the organization, either alone or together with stakeholders, such as operational-level grievance mechanisms and collective bargaining, including the mechanisms established by collective bargaining. They also include mechanisms administered by industry associations, international organizations, civil society organizations, or multi-stakeholder groups.\r\n\r\nOperational-level grievance mechanisms are administered by the organization either alone or in collaboration with other parties and are directly accessible by the organization’s stakeholders. They allow for grievances to be identified and addressed early and directly, thereby preventing both harm and grievances from escalating. They also provide important feedback on the effectiveness of the organization’s due diligence from those who are directly affected.\r\nThe organization can describe:\r\n• the intended purpose and users of the mechanisms (i.e., whether they are intended for a particular stakeholder category, topic, or region) and whether they enable users to raise human rights-related concerns. For example, the organization can explain that it has established a mechanism for community members to raise complaints about resettlement, as well as a separate hotline for workers to raise concerns about issues affecting their\r\nrights, such as health and safety conditions;\r\n• how the mechanisms operate and who administers them (the organization or another party); whether operational-level grievance mechanisms are administered at the organizational level or whether they are administered at a lower level (at the site or project level) and, in such a case, how information from these mechanisms is centralized;\r\n• how the mechanisms have been designed and on which principles and guidelines they are based, including whether they are designed to meet the effectiveness criteria set out in UN Guiding Principle 31 [14];\r\n• the process through which grievances are investigated;\r\n• whether grievances are communicated to the highest governance body;\r\n• whether grievances are treated confidentially;\r\n• whether the mechanisms can be used by stakeholders anonymously through representation by a third party;\r\n• whether the organization requires or provides incentives for the creation or improvement of operational-level grievance mechanisms in workplaces of suppliers;\r\n• whether the organization provides a back-up process for workplaces of suppliers that do not have operational-level grievance mechanisms or where the existing grievance mechanisms in those workplaces result in unresolved issues.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-25-c\r\nRequirement 2-25-c covers remediation processes other than grievance mechanisms. Such processes lead to the remediation of an impact without mechanisms for filing a formal complaint.\r\n\r\nExamples include instances where the organization takes action to remediate an actual impact evidenced in an impact assessment or a report published by a civil society organization. \r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-25-d\r\nThe organization can describe, for example, how it engages with stakeholders who are the intended users of the grievance mechanisms, to understand how they want to access the mechanisms to raise concerns, and their expectations about how the mechanisms will operate.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-25-e\r\nAccording to UN Guiding Principle 31 [14], effective grievance mechanisms are legitimate, accessible, predictable, equitable, transparent, rights-compatible, and a source of continuous learning. In addition to these criteria, effective operational-level grievance mechanisms are also based on engagement and dialogue. It can be more difficult for the organization to assess the effectiveness of grievance mechanisms that it participates in compared to those it has established itself.\r\n\r\nThe organization can report:\r\n• whether and how the intended users are trained to use the grievance mechanisms and remediation processes;\r\n• the accessibility of the grievance mechanisms and remediation processes, such as the number of hours per day or days per week they are accessible, and their availability in different languages;\r\n• how the organization seeks to ensure it respects users’ human rights and protects them against reprisals (i.e., non-retaliation for raising complaints or concerns);\r\n• how satisfied users are with the grievance mechanisms and remediation processes, and with the resulting outcomes, as well as how the organization assesses user satisfaction;\r\n• the number and types of grievances filed during the reporting period, and the percentage of grievances that were addressed and resolved, including the percentage that were resolved through remediation;\r\n• the number of grievances filed during the reporting period that are repeated or recurring; changes made to the grievance mechanisms and remediation processes in response to lessons learned about their effectiveness\r\n\r\nQuantitative data, such as the number of grievances, is unlikely to be sufficient on its own. For example, a low number of grievances could indicate that few incidents have occurred, but it could also signal that their intended users do not trust the mechanisms. For this reason, contextual information should be provided to help information users interpret the data."

For more information on stakeholders, see section 2.4 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.\r\nThis disclosure covers stakeholder engagement undertaken by the organization as part of its ongoing activities, rather than specifically for the purpose of sustainability reporting.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-29-a-i\r\nCommon categories of stakeholders for organizations are business partners, civil society   organizations, consumers, customers, employees and other workers, governments, local communities, non-governmental organizations, shareholders and other investors, suppliers, trade unions, and vulnerable groups. The organization can explain how it determines which categories of stakeholders to engage with and which categories not to engage with.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-29-a-ii\r\nThe purpose of stakeholder engagement can be, for example, to identify actual and potential impacts or to determine prevention and mitigation responses to potential negative impacts. In some cases, stakeholder engagement is a right in and of itself, such as the right of workers to form or join trade unions or their right to bargain collectively. \r\nThe organization can also report:\r\n•the type of stakeholder engagement (e.g., participation, consultation, information) and its frequency (e.g., ongoing, quarterly, annually);\r\n• when it engages directly with stakeholders and when it engages with credible stakeholder representatives or proxy organizations, or other credible independent expert resources, and why;\r\n•whether stakeholder engagement activities take place at the organizational level or at a lower level, such as at the site or project level, and in the latter case, how information from stakeholder engagement activities is centralized;\r\n• the resources (e.g., financial or human resources) allocated to stakeholder engagement. \r\nFurther information on stakeholder engagement undertaken for specific activities is reported under other disclosures. For example, the organization must report on stakeholder engagement undertaken to determine and manage material topics under 3-1-b and 3-3-f in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-29-a-iii\r\nMeaningful stakeholder engagement is characterized by two-way communication and depends on the good faith of participants on both sides. It is also responsive and ongoing and includes in many cases engaging with relevant stakeholders before decisions are made.

                  "answer": "This disclosure provides insights into how the organization engages in collective bargaining  with its employees. Collective bargaining is a fundamental right at work covered in the International Labour Organization (ILO) Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention [8].\r\n\r\nCollective bargaining refers to negotiations that take place between one or more employers or employers' organizations and one or more workers' organizations (e.g., trade unions). The objective of these negotiations is to reach a collective agreement on working conditions and terms of employment (e.g., wages, working time) and to regulate relations between employers and workers. [3] These negotiations are an important means through which employers’ organizations and workers’ organizations can improve working conditions and labor relations.\r\n\r\nCollective agreements can be made at the level of the organization, at the level of a particular site, at the industry level, and at the national level in countries where this is the practice.\r\n\r\nCollective agreements can cover specific groups of workers, for example, those performing a specific activity or working at a specific location. If the organization has a statement or policy commitment on freedom of association and collective bargaining, this is reported under 2-23-b-i in this Standard or 3-3-c in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-30-a\r\nThe organization is required to report the percentage of its employees whose working conditions and terms of employment are regulated by one or more collective bargaining agreements. The percentage of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements is calculated using the following formula:= (Number of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements /Total number of employees reported under 2-7-a) X 100\r\n\r\nThe employees covered by collective bargaining agreements are those employees to whom the organization is obligated to apply the agreement. This means that if none of the employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the percentage reported is zero. An employee covered by more than one collective bargaining agreement only needs to be counted once. This requirement does not ask for the percentage of employees represented by a works council or belonging to trade unions, which can be different. The percentage of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can be higher than the percentage of unionized employees\r\nwhen the collective bargaining agreements apply to both union and non-union members.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the percentage of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can be lower than the percentage of unionized employees. This may be the case when there are no collective bargaining agreements available or when the collective bargaining agreements do not cover all unionized employees.\r\n\r\nThe organization can also provide a breakdown of the percentage of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements by region, or provide comparisons with industry benchmarks.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 2-30-b\r\nThere may be instances where collective bargaining agreements cover some or none of the organization’s employees. However, the working conditions and terms of employment of these employees may be influenced or determined by the organization based on other collective bargaining agreements, such as agreements that cover other employees or agreements from other organizations. If this is the case, the organization is required to report it under 2-30-b. If this is not the case, and the working conditions and terms of employment of these employees arenot influenced or determined based on other collective bargaining agreements, a brief statement of this fact is sufficient to comply with this requirement."

                  "answer": "This disclosure requires information on how the organization has determined its material topics. The list of material topics is reported under Disclosure 3-2 in this Standard. The organization is required to use the applicable GRI Sector Standards when determining its material topics. If any of the topics that are included in the applicable Sector Standards have been determined by the organization as not material, the organization is required to list them in\r\nthe GRI content index and explain why they are not material. See Requirement 5 and Requirement 7 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 and Box 5 in this Standard for more information.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of applicable Sector Standards, the organization should explain how it has considered impacts commonly associated with its sectors, and whether any of these impactshave been determined as not material, together with an explanation for why this is the case. The organization should also explain how it has considered impacts commonly associated with its products and geographic locations. See section 1 in this Standard and the Sector Standards for guidance on impacts commonly associated with sectors, products, and geographic locations.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 3-1-a-i\r\nThe organization should describe the methods used to identify its impacts, for example, economic, environmental, social, and human rights impact assessments, grievance mechanisms, or using information from external sources, such as civil society organizations. The organization should describe the sources and the evidence it has used to identify the impacts. The organization should also describe the scope it has defined when identifying the impacts, for example, whether it has identified short-term as well as long-term impacts. The organization should also describe any limitations or exclusions, for example, whether it has excluded  business relationships from certain parts of its value chain when identifying the impacts.\r\nDisclosure 2-12 in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 requires information on the role of the highest governance body in overseeing the organization’s due diligence and other processes to identify its impacts on the economy, environment, and people.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 3-1-a-ii\r\nThe organization should describe how it has assessed the significance of the impacts, including any assumptions and subjective judgments it has made. The significance of an actual negative impact is determined by the severity of the impact (scale, scope, and irremediable character), while the significance of a potential negative impact is determined by the severity and likelihood of the impact. In the case of potential negative human rights impacts, the severity of the impact takes precedence over its likelihood. The significance of an actual positive impact is determined by the scale and scope of the impact, while the significance of a potential positive impact is determined by its scale and scope as well as its likelihood.\r\nSee section 1 in this Standard for more guidance on assessing the significance of impacts. The organization should explain if it has used a different approach to prioritize its impacts, for example, if it has prioritized potential negative environmental impacts based on severity only.\r\nThe organization should also describe how it has defined the threshold to determine which topics are material for reporting, and whether it has tested its selection of material topics with potential information users and experts. The organization is required to report whether the highest governance body is responsible for reviewing and approving the reported information, including the organization’s material topics, under Disclosure 2-14 in GRI 2. The organization should explain any changes to its initial selection of material topics following internal approval and testing with potential information users and experts. For transparency, the organization can provide a visual representation of the prioritization that shows the initial list of topics it has identified and the threshold it has set for reporting.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 3-1-b\r\nRequirement 3-1-b enables the organization to explain how engagement with stakeholders and experts informs the ongoing identification and assessment of its impacts. The organization can report whether and how it has prioritized stakeholders for engagement and the methods used to engage with them. It can also report any conflicting interests that have arisen among different stakeholders and how the organization has resolved these conflicting interests."

This means that the organization is required to report this disclosure for each of its material topics. The requirements in this disclosure apply to every material topic. In addition to this disclosure, there may also be disclosures and guidance in the Topic Standards and Sector Standards that address reporting information about how the organization\r\nmanages a topic. For example, some Topic Standards contain disclosures about specific actions or methods to manage a topic. The organization does not need to repeat this information under Disclosure 3-3 if it is already reported under another disclosure. The organization can report the information once and provide a reference to this information to fulfill the corresponding requirements in Disclosure 3-3.\r\n\r\nIf the organization’s approach to managing a material topic, such as its policies or actions taken, applies to other material topics, the organization does not need to repeat this information for each topic. The organization can report this information once, with a clear explanation of all the topics it covers.\r\n\r\nIf the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in this disclosure because the item (e.g., policy, action) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.\r\nIf the organization does not manage a material topic, it can comply with the requirements under this disclosure by explaining the reasons for not managing the topic or describing any plans to manage it.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 3-3-a\r\nRequirement 3-3-a enables the organization to indicate if a topic is material because of negative impacts, positive impacts, or both. It does not require a list of all the impacts identified or a detailed description of the impacts. Instead, the organization can provide a high-level overview of the impacts it has identified.\r\n\r\nDescribing negative impacts\r\nThe organization can describe:\r\n• whether the negative impacts are actual or potential; \r\n• the time frame of the negative impacts (i.e., whether the negative effects are short-term or long-term and when they are likely to arise);\r\n• whether the negative impacts are systemic (e.g., child labor or forced labor in countries where the organization operates or sources materials from) or are related to individual incidents (e.g., an oil spill);\r\n• the economic resources, environmental resources, and stakeholders (without identifying specific individuals) that are negatively affected or could be negatively affected, including their geographic location.\r\n\r\nReporting information about negative impacts can help the organization demonstrate that it recognizes these impacts and has taken action or intends to address them. The organization may have concerns about reporting information about negative impacts even if these impacts are publicly known. In cases where negative impacts are publicly known, failure to acknowledge these impacts and to explain how they are being addressed could have consequences for the organization financially, operationally, or reputationally. If the organization is unable to disclose specific information (e.g., because of stakeholders’ right to privacy), it can provide the information in aggregated or anonymized form, or it can make a reference to the impacts commonly associated with its sectors, its products, or geographic locations. \r\n\r\nDescribing positive impacts\r\nThe organization can describe:\r\n• whether the positive impacts are actual or potential;\r\n•the time frame of the positive impacts (i.e., whether the positive effects are short-term or long-term and when they are likely to arise);\r\n•the activities that result in the positive impacts (e.g., products, services, investments, procurement practices);\r\n• the economic resources, environmental resources, and stakeholders (without identifying specific individuals) that are positively affected or could be positively affected, including their geographic location.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 3-3-b\r\nThe way the organization is involved with negative impacts determines how it should address the impacts and whether it has a responsibility to provide for or cooperate in their remediation (see section 2.3 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021). Requirement 3-3-b provides contextual information  that aids an understanding of the actions taken by the organization to manage its negative impacts. The actions taken are reported under 3-3-d-i and 3-3-d-ii.\r\nUnder requirement 3-3-b, the organization is required to report whether it is involved with the negative impacts through its activities or as a result of its business relationships. Where possible, the organization should also report:\r\n• whether it is or could be causing or contributing to the negative impacts through its activities;\r\nor\r\n• whether the impacts are or could be directly linked to its operations, products, or services by its business relationships even if it has not contributed to them.\r\n\r\nUnder requirement 3-3-b, the organization is also required to describe the activities or business relationships. This enables the organization to indicate if the impacts related to a material topic are widespread in the organization’s activities or business relationships, or if the impacts concern specific activities or business relationships.\r\n\r\n If the impacts concern specific activities, the organization should describe the types of activities\r\n(e.g., manufacturing, retail) and their geographic location. If the impacts concern specific business relationships, the organization should describe the types of business relationships (e.g., suppliers of raw materials, franchisees), their position in the value chain, and their geographic location\r\n\r\nFor example, if the organization has identified that its activities at specific sites could cause water pollution, it should describe the types of activities carried out at these sites and the geographic location of these sites. Or, if the organization has identified that it is directly linked to child labor by the business relationships in its supply chain, it should specify the types of suppliers using child labor (e.g., sub-contractors doing embroidery work for the organization’s products) and the geographic location of these suppliers.\r\nThe organization can provide additional contextual information for understanding the extent of its impacts. Adding to the previous examples, the organization can report how many of its sites could cause water pollution (e.g., 60% of sites, five out of 12 sites) or the proportion of roduction these sites represent, or it can report the estimated number of sub-contractors using child labor that do embroidery work for the organization.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 3-3-c\r\nRequirement 3-3-c entails describing the policies or commitments the organization has developed specifically for the topic, in addition to the policy commitments reported under Disclosure 2-23 in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021. If the organization has described its policies for a material topic under Disclosure 2-23, it can provide a reference to this information under 3-3-c and does not need to repeat the information. See Disclosure 2-23 in GRI 2 for guidance on how to report information about policies.\r\n\r\nWhen reporting its commitments regarding the material topic, the organization should provide a statement of intent to manage the topic or explain:\r\n• the organization’s stance on the topic;\r\n• whether the commitment to manage the topic is based on regulatory compliance or extends beyond it;\r\n• compliance with authoritative intergovernmental instruments related to the topic.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 3-3-d\r\nRequirement 3-3-d enables the organization to explain how it responds to its impacts. It does not require a detailed description of actions taken in relation to each impact. Instead, the organization can provide a high-level overview of how it manages its impacts. The organization should report how it integrates the findings from its identification and assessment of impacts across relevant internal functions and processes, including:\r\n• the level and function within the organization that has been assigned responsibility for managing the impacts;\r\n• the internal decision-making, budget allocation, and oversight processes (e.g., internal audit) to enable effective actions to manage the impacts.\r\n\r\nDisclosure 2-12 and Disclosure 2-13 in GRI 2 require information on the role of the highest governance body in overseeing the management of the organization’s impacts and on how it delegates responsibility for this.\r\n\r\nThe organization should also report how it manages actual impacts identified in previous reporting periods and which it continues to manage during the current reporting period.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 3-3-d-i\r\nThe organization should report:\r\n• examples of actions taken to prevent or mitigate potential negative impacts (e.g.,adaptation/modification measures, facility upgrading, training, red-flag systems);\r\n• approaches taken to prevent or mitigate systemic negative impacts;\r\n•how the organization applies the precautionary principle, including:\r\n- how the organization proactively informs the public about potential negative impacts of its activities, products, and services, and how it deals with related questions and complaints;\r\n-the organization’s support or contribution to scientific research related to evaluating potential negative impacts of its activities, products, and services;\r\n- the organization’s participation in collaborative efforts to share knowledge and to prevent negative impacts of its activities, products, and services;\r\n• how the organization uses or increases its leverage to motivate its business relationships to prevent or mitigate potential negative impacts. For example, whether the organization uses or increases its leverage by enforcing contractual requirements, implements incentives such  as future orders, provides training and support, or actively collaborates with other actors to motivate its business relationships to prevent or mitigate potential negative impacts;\r\n•  whether the organization has terminated a business relationship because it lacks the leverage to prevent or mitigate potential negative impacts and, if so, whether it has assessed if terminating the relationship could itself result in negative impacts.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 3-3-d-ii\r\nThe organization should report:\r\n•examples of actions taken to remediate actual negative impacts, including examples of specific remedies or types of remedy provided;\r\n• how grievance mechanisms or other remediation processes (reported under Disclosure 2-25 in GRI 2) have made it possible for actual negative impacts to be remediated. \r\nSee Disclosure 2-25 in GRI 2 for more information on processes to remediate negative impacts.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 3-3-e\r\nRequirement 3-3-e enables the organization to report information about the effectiveness of its actions to manage its impacts. Tracking the effectiveness of its actions is necessary for an organization to learn if its policies and processes are being implemented optimally. It is also necessary for knowing if it has responded effectively to its impacts and to drive continuous improvement.\r\nThe organization should also report information about the effectiveness of its actions to manage actual impacts from previous reporting periods. This applies in cases where the organization has assessed the effectiveness of these actions or derived lessons during the current reporting period.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 3-3-e-i\r\nProcesses used to track the effectiveness of actions can include internal or external auditing or verification, impact assessments, measurement systems, stakeholder feedback, grievance mechanisms, external performance ratings, and benchmarking. \r\n\r\nGuidance to 3-3-e-ii\r\nWhen reporting on goals and targets, the organization should report:\r\n• how the goals and targets are set;\r\n• whether and how the goals and targets take into account the sustainability context in which the impacts take place (e.g., sustainable development goals and conditions, the limits and demands placed on environmental resources). See the Sustainability context principle in GRI 1 for more information;\r\n• whether the goals and targets are informed by expectations in authoritative intergovernmental instruments and, where relevant, by scientific consensus;\r\n• whether goals and targets are mandatory (based on legislation) or voluntary. If they are mandatory, the organization can list the relevant legislation;\r\n• the organization’s activities or business relationships to which the goals and targets apply;\r\n• the baseline for the goals and targets;\r\n• the timeline for achieving the goals and targets.\r\n\r\nTargets can be qualitative (e.g., implementing a management system by a certain date) or quantitative (e.g., reducing greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions by a certain percentage by a certain date).\r\nThe indicators used to evaluate progress can also be qualitative or quantitative. Quantitative indicators can bring precision and enable comparisons. Qualitative information is often needed to put quantitative information into context, enable its interpretation, and determine which comparisons and conclusions are likely to be most valid. The Topic Standards and Sector Standards include qualitative and quantitative indicators\r\n\r\nGuidance to 3-3-e-iii\r\nRequirement 3-3-e-iii enables the organization to show the extent to which the actions taken have been effective. Information on the effectiveness of the actions can be obtained, for example,from the outcomes of internal or external auditing or verification, data collected through measurement systems, and stakeholder feedback. The organization should show that there is a credible link between the specific action taken by the organization and the effective management of impacts.\r\n\r\nFor example, to show the effectiveness of its actions to support its suppliers with improving their working conditions, the organization can report survey feedback from the suppliers’ workers showing that working conditions have improved. Additional information the organization can provide includes data showing a decrease in the number of incidents identified through independent audits.  Similarly, to demonstrate the effectiveness of its actions to improve the quality of its water discharge, the organization can report data showing a decrease in the concentration of total dissolved solids (mg/L) in the water discharge.\r\n\r\nWhen reporting progress toward its goals and targets, the organization should report whether  progress is satisfactory or not. If a goal or target has not been achieved, the organization should explain why.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 3-3-e-iv\r\nManaging impacts is typically an ongoing process requiring continuous improvement based on learning from practice. \r\n\r\nThe organization is not required to provide a detailed description of lessons learned in relation to each material topic. Instead, the organization can provide examples to show how it incorporates lessons learned to manage impacts more successfully in the future. For example, the organization can briefly describe lessons learned that have led to changes in its policies or practices (e.g., training for workers, giving additional attention to the performance of suppliers), or that have led to plans for changes that will manage impacts more successfully in the future.\r\n\r\nLessons learned may be derived from the organization’s own processes (e.g., root cause analysis), from its business relationships, or from stakeholder or expert feedback.\r\n\r\nGuidance to 3-3-f\r\nThe organization can explain, for example, whether and how affected stakeholders have been involved in determining an appropriate remedy for a negative impact or how stakeholder feedback is used to assess the effectiveness of the actions taken.\r\n"

                  "answer": "Guidance for Disclosure 303-1\r\nThrough its value chain, an organization can affect both the quality as well as the availability of water. If the reporting organization has identified significant water-related impacts in the value chain, which includes activities carried out by the organization, and by entities upstream and downstream from the organization, it is required to report information about these impacts. See Guidance to 3-3-b in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 for more information about reporting an organization’s involvement with negative impacts.\r\n\r\nThe description of how the organization interacts with water can include information on specific catchments where water is withdrawn, consumed, and discharged, and information on what the water is used for in activities carried out by the organization and by entities upstream and downstream from the organization (e.g., for cooling, storage, incorporating in products, growing crops).\r\n\r\nIn the context of this Standard, suppliers with significant water-related impacts may include suppliers of water-intensive commodities or services, suppliers located in areas with water stress, and/or suppliers with significant impacts on the local water environment and the related local communities.\r\n\r\nIf applicable, the organization can describe its environmental impacts caused by runoff, and how they are addressed. For example, runoff can carry high-nutrient and pollution loads due to the organization’s activities, leading to eutrophication and other negative impacts on local waterbodies.\r\n\r\nGuidance for Disclosure 303-1-b\r\nWhen assessing impacts, it is important that the organization consider its future impacts on water quality and availability, as these factors can change over time. Tools and methodologies for identifying impacts can include life cycle assessments, environmental impact assessments, water footprint assessments, scenario analysis, and stakeholder engagement. If information i s estimated or modeled, rather than sourced from direct measurements, the organization can explain its estimation or modeling methods. \r\n\r\nGuidance for Disclosure 303-1-c\r\nWorking with stakeholders is critical for an organization to steward water as a shared resource and account for the needs of other water users of the catchment. An organization’s stakeholders can include\r\n• suppliers with significant water-related impacts;\r\n• users of its products and services;\r\n• local communities and action groups;\r\n• employees and other workers;\r\n• other water users in its sector or industry;\r\n• governments, regulators, and civil society organizations;\r\n• global initiatives, trade associations, and partnerships. \r\n\r\nThe organization can describe how it participates in discussions with stakeholders, the frequency of this engagement, and its role in these discussions. Outcomes of working with stakeholders can include, for example, collective target-setting for water use, increased investment in infrastructure, policy advocacy, and capacity building and awareness raising. When reporting on its engagement with suppliers, the organization can describe:\r\n•how the organization engages with its suppliers to help them improve their water management practices;\r\n• the number of suppliers engaged;\r\n• the outcomes of this engagement;\r\n• the amount of procurement that the proportion of engaged suppliers represents;\r\n• why information is not requested from suppliers with significant water-related impacts;\r\n• future plans and goals for working with suppliers to reduce water-related impacts \r\n\r\nWater impacts related to products and services might be addressed by, for example, improving product design, providing information and advice on the responsible use of products and services, and holding regular consultations with users.\r\n\r\nGuidance for Disclosure 303-1-d\r\n Meaningful targets for managing water-related impacts:\r\n• account for the local context where water is withdrawn and discharged;\r\n• are scientifically informed by sustainable thresholds and the social context of a given catchment;\r\n• align with public sector efforts, such as the water- related targets of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, in particular Goal 6, or targets set by national and local government institutions;\r\n• are informed by the advocacy of other stakeholders, such as civil society organizations, trade associations, and action groups. \r\nSee references [2] and [4] in the Bibliography. https://www.globalreporting.org/pdf.ashx?id=12488\r\nThe organization can report its progress toward the goals and targets using 3-3-e-iii in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.

Reporting the volume of water consumption can help the organization understand the overall scale of its impact due to water withdrawal on downstream water availability. \r\n\r\nGuidance for Disclosure 303-5\r\nFor an example how to present information on requirements in Disclosure 303-5, see Table 1. See Guidance for Disclosure 303-3-b for how to assess areas with water stress. If the reporting organization cannot directly measure water consumption, it may calculate this using the following formula: \r\n\r\nWater consumption = Total water withdrawal - Total water discharge\r\n\r\nGuidance for Disclosure 303-5-c\r\nIf the water in storage has been identified as having a significant water-related impact, the\r\norganization is required to report change in water storage. The organization may calculate\r\nchange in water storage using the following formula: \r\n\r\nChange in water storage = Total water storage at the end of the reporting period - Total water storage at the beginning of the reporting period\r\n\r\nGuidance for clause 2.5.1\r\nTo compile this information, the organization can use the following approach: (a) determine\r\nwhich facilities are located in areas with water stress, (b) for each of these facilities, report the\r\ntotal water consumption. For an example of how to present this information, see Table 2.\r\n\r\nGuidance for clause 2.5.2\r\nTo compile this information, the organization can use the following approach: (a) determine\r\nwhich suppliers are located in areas with water stress, (b) determine which of these suppliers\r\ncause significant water-related impacts, (c) add up the total water consumption of each of these\r\nsuppliers, (d) report the sum. For an example of how to present this information, see Table 3.\r\n\r\nFor  the tables please refer to this link : https://www.globalreporting.org/publications/documents/english/gri-303-water-and-effluents-2018/ "

                  "answer": "Background\r\nThe quantity, type, and quality of waste generated by an organization is a consequence of the activities involved in the production of its products and services (e.g., extraction, processing, procurement of materials, product or service design, production, distribution) and their subsequent consumption. An assessment of how materials move into, through, and out of the organization can help understand where in the organization’s value chain these materials eventually become waste. This provides a holistic overview of waste generation and its causes, which in turn can support the organization in identifying opportunities for waste prevention and for adopting circularity measures. In this way, the organization can go beyond mitigating and remediating negative impacts once waste has been generated and move towards managing waste as a resource.\r\n\r\nGuidance for Disclosure 306-1\r\nWhen reporting on this disclosure, the organization can specify the types of inputs and outputs. The types of inputs and outputs can include raw materials, process and manufacturing materials, leaks and losses, waste, by-products, products, or packaging.\r\n\r\nThe organization can assess and report whether inputs, activities, and outputs lead or could lead to significant waste-related impacts using the following criteria:\r\n• Quantity of inputs used to produce the organization’s products or services, which will become waste after they are used for production.\r\n• Quantity of waste outputs generated in the organization’s own activities, or quantity of outputs it provides to entities downstream that will eventually become waste when they reach their end of life.\r\n• Hazardous characteristics of inputs and outputs.\r\n•Properties of input materials or design characteristics of outputs that limit or prevent their recovery or limit the length of their life.\r\n• Known potential negative threats associated with specific materials when they are discarded. For example, the potential threat of marine pollution resulting from leakage of discarded plastic packaging into waterbodies.\r\n• Types of activities that lead to significant quantities of waste generation or to generation of hazardous waste.\r\n\r\nThe organization is required to report on inputs that it receives from entities upstream in its value chain, as well as outputs it provides to entities downstream in its value chain. For example, if an organization procures components with hazardous characteristics from a supplier and uses these in a product that will continue to carry these components and their hazardous characteristics, the organization is required to report these components under inputs that lead or could lead to significant waste-related impacts. Similarly, if an organization sells to consumers products that generate large quantities of packaging waste, it is required to report this packaging under outputs that lead or could lead to significant waste-related impacts.\r\n\r\nIf the organization has identified many inputs and outputs or many activities that lead or could lead to significant waste-related impacts, it may group these by:\r\n• product or service category that the inputs and outputs relate to;\r\n• business units or facilities that procure the inputs, or whose activities produce the outputs;\r\n•categories of upstream and downstream activities that produce the outputs (for examples of upstream and downstream categories, see the guidance for Disclosure 302-2 in GRI 302: Energy 2016).\r\n\r\nGuidance for clause 1.2\r\nA process flow is a tool to visualize the information required to be reported under Disclosure 306-1. A graphic illustration of the process flow can help the organization and its stakeholders understand how inputs and outputs move through the organization’s own activities as well as through the activities of entities upstream and downstream in its value chain. It shows where waste is generated in the value chain or where outputs become waste.\r\nThe organization can also use the process flow to illustrate information that is required under other disclosures of this Standard, such as\r\n•actions taken to prevent waste generation (Disclosure 306-2);\r\n• composition of waste generated (Disclosure 306-3);\r\n• recovery operations used to divert waste from disposal (Disclosure 306-4);\r\n• disposal operations (Disclosure 306-5).\r\nThe organization can include estimates of the weight of inputs and the weight of outputs in metric tons or the ratio of inputs to outputs"

                  "answer": "Background\r\nAn organization can cause waste-related impacts through its own activities. For example, when its operations generate waste outputs. It can also contribute to waste-related impacts through activities carried out in its value chain upstream or downstream. For example, through criteria in its procurement policies that lead to waste generation upstream, or through management decisions that limit the life of its products and therefore contribute to waste generation downstream.\r\n\r\nEven when the organization has not contributed to waste-related impacts upstream or downstream in its value chain, its operations, products, or services could be directly linked to waste-related impacts by its business relationships with the entities in its value chain. For example, when third parties hired by the organization carry out inadequate recovery or disposal operations.\r\n\r\nThe way an organization is involved with negative impacts is important for determining the organization’s response to an impact.\r\n\r\nGuidance for Disclosure 306-2-a\r\nActions, including circularity measures, to prevent waste generation and to manage significant impacts from waste generated can include:\r\n•Input material choices and product design:\r\n-Improving materials selection and product design through consideration for longevity and\r\ndurability, repairability, modularity and disassembly, and recyclability.\r\n-Reducing the use of raw and finite materials by procuring secondary materials (e.g., used or recycled input materials) or renewable materials.\r\n-Substituting inputs that have hazardous characteristics with inputs that are nonhazardous.\r\n\r\n•Collaboration in the value chain and business model innovation:\r\n-Setting policies for procurement from suppliers that have sound waste prevention and waste management criteria.\r\n-Engaging in or setting up industrial symbiosis as a result of which the organization’s waste or other outputs (e.g., by-products from production) become inputs for another organization.\r\n- Participating in a collective or individual extended producer responsibility scheme or applying product stewardship, which extends the producer’s responsibility for a product or service to its end of life.\r\n-Transitioning to and applying new business models, such as product service systems that use services instead of products to meet consumer demand.\r\n- Engaging in or setting up product take-back schemes and reverse logistics processes to divert products and materials from disposal.\r\n\r\n•End-of-life interventions:\r\n-Establishing and improving facilities for waste management, including facilities for the collection and sorting of waste.\r\n-Recovering products, components, and materials from waste through preparation for reuse and recycling.\r\n- Engaging with consumers to raise awareness about sustainable consumption practices, such as reduced purchasing of products, product sharing, exchange, reuse, and recycling.\r\n\r\nGuidance for Disclosure 306-2-b\r\nThis disclosure can provide insight into the level of control the organization assumes for waste management outsourced to a third party. In the context of this Standard, a third party includes a public or private waste management organization, or any other entity or group of individuals formally or informally involved in handling the reporting organization’s waste. Waste management by third parties can include the collection, transportation, recovery, and disposal of waste, as well as the supervision of such operations and the aftercare of disposal sites. The organization may specify agreements in a contract for the third party to follow when managing its waste, or rely on existing legislative obligations, such as local environmental laws and regulations, to ensure that the third party manages the waste adequately.\r\n\r\nGuidance for Disclosure 306-2-c\r\nThe processes that the organization has in place for collecting and monitoring waste-related data can reflect its commitment to managing waste-related impacts. Such processes can include online data entry, maintaining a centralized database, real-time weighbridge measurement, and annual external data validation. The organization can specify whether the data collection and monitoring processes extend beyond waste generated in its own activities to include waste generated upstream and downstream in its value chain."

It is a systems-based approach that seeks to integrate occupational health and safety management into overall business processes. A system typically moves through a ‘plan-do-check-act’ cycle, promoting leadership and practice through meaningful consultation and participation of workers from all job levels in the organization.\r\nA systems-based approach, which encompasses fully integrated processes, can be a significant advancement over an approach that considers hazard identification, risk assessment, and incident investigation as isolated activities. Focusing on system deficiencies can enable an organization to identify deficiencies in its overall management of occupational health and safety; address resources, policy, and operational controls; and ensure continual improvement.\r\nGuidance for Disclosure 403-8\r\nThis disclosure indicates what proportion of an organization’s employees, and workers who are not employees but whose work and/or workplace is controlled by the organization, are covered by an occupational health and safety management system based on legal requirements and/or recognized standards/guidelines. The list of legal requirements and/or recognized standards/guidelines used by the reporting organization in its occupational health and safety management system are reported using Disclosures 403-1-a-i and 403-1-a-ii in the Topic management disclosures section.\r\nIf not all workers are covered by the occupational health and safety management system, the organization can report whether any of the workers not covered are at high risk of work-related injury or ill health.\r\nIn addition to the information required by this disclosure, the organization can report the number and percentage of sites covered by an occupational health and safety management system based on legal requirements and/or recognized standards/guidelines.\r\nThe organization can also describe:\r\n \r\n•\tthe approach used for internal audits (e.g., whether they are carried out following an internally-developed audit standard or a recognized audit standard, what is the qualification\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nof the auditors);\r\n•\twhether any processes or functions have been excluded from the scope of the audit or certification, and how occupational health and safety performance is being monitored in those areas;\r\n•\tthe audit or certification standard used.\r\n\r\nAudits by external parties may include both second-party and third-party audits. Second-party audits are usually performed by customers or others on behalf of customers, or by any other external parties that have a formal interest in the organization. Third-party audits are performed by independent organizations such as registrars (i.e., certification bodies) or regulators.\r\nGuidance for Disclosure 403-8-b\r\nTypes of worker can be based on criteria such as full-time, part-time, non-guaranteed hours, permanent or temporary basis, type or degree of control (e.g., control of work or workplace, sole or shared control), and location, among others"

It can also draw from recognized international data sources, such as the ILO Information and reports on the application of Conventions and Recommendations (see reference [1] in the Bibliography).\r\nWhen reporting the measures taken, the organization can refer to the ILO ‘Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy’ and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises for further guidance.\r\nIn the context of the GRI Standards, a ‘young worker’ is defined as a person above the applicable minimum working age and younger than 18 years of age. Note that Disclosure 408-1 does not require quantitative reporting on child labor or the number of young workers. Rather, it asks for reporting on the operations and suppliers considered to have significant risk for incidents of child labor or young workers exposed to hazardous work.\r\nBackground\r\nChild labor is subject to ILO Conventions 138 ‘Minimum Age Convention’ (ILO Convention 138) and 182 ‘Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention’ (ILO Convention 182).\r\n‘Child labor’ refers to an abuse, which is not to be confused with ‘children working’ or with ‘young persons working’, which may not be abuses as stipulated in ILO Convention 138.\r\nThe minimum age for working differs by country. ILO Convention 138 specifies a minimum age of 15 years or the age of completion of compulsory schooling (whichever is higher). However, there is an exception for certain countries where economies and educational facilities are insufficiently developed and a minimum age of 14 years might apply. These countries of exception are specified by the ILO in response to special application by the country concerned, and in consultation with representative organizations of employers and workers.\r\nILO Convention 138 stipulates that ‘national laws or regulations may permit the employment or work of persons 13 to 15 years of age on light work which is (a) not likely to be harmful to their health or development; and (b) not such as to prejudice their attendance at school, their participation in vocational orientation or training programmes approved by the competent authority or their capacity to benefit from the instruction received’.\r\nWhile child labor takes many different forms, a priority is to eliminate without delay the worst forms of child labor as defined by Article 3 of ILO Convention 182. This includes all forms of slavery or practices similar to slavery (such as sale, trafficking, forced or compulsory labor,\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nserfdom, recruitment for armed conflict); the use, procuring or offering of a child for prostitution or illicit activities and any work that is likely to harm the health, safety or morals of children. ILO Convention 182 is intended to set priorities for states; however, organizations are expected not to use this convention to justify forms of child labor.\r\nChild labor results in under-skilled and unhealthy workers for tomorrow and perpetuates poverty across generations, thus impeding sustainable development. The abolition of child labor is therefore necessary for both economic and human development."

The most extreme examples are slave labor and bonded labor, but debts can also be used as a means of maintaining workers in a state of forced labor. Indicators of forced labor can also include withholding identity papers, requiring compulsory deposits, and compelling workers, under threat of firing, to work extra hours to which they have not previously agreed.\r\nEliminating forced labor remains an important challenge. Forced labor is not only a serious violation of a fundamental human right, it also perpetuates poverty and is a hindrance to economic and human development.5\r\n \r\nThe presence and effective implementation of policies for eliminating all forms of forced or compulsory labor are a basic expectation of responsible business conduct.

Different policy statements can exist at a regional level.\r\nAn organization can identify the collective bargaining agreements referred to in Disclosure 2-30 of GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021, and review the notice period clauses within these documents.\r\nBackground\r\nOrganizations are expected to provide reasonable notice of significant operational changes to employees and their representatives, as well as to appropriate government authorities.\r\nMinimum notice periods are a measure of an organization’s ability to maintain employee satisfaction and motivation while implementing significant changes to operations.\r\nThis disclosure provides insight into an organization’s practice of ensuring timely discussion of significant operational changes, and engaging with its employees and their representatives to negotiate and implement these changes, which can have positive or negative implications for workers.\r\nThis disclosure also allows an assessment of an organization’s consultation practices in relation to expectations expressed in relevant international norms.\r\nThe essence of consultation is that management takes the views of workers into account when making specific decisions. Therefore, it is important that consultation takes place before a decision is made. Meaningful consultation includes the timely provision of all information needed to make an informed decision to workers or their representatives. Genuine consultation involves dialogue; opinion surveys and questionnaires are not considered consultation.\r\nTimely and meaningful consultation allows the affected parties to understand the impacts of the changes, such as possible loss of employment. It also gives an opportunity for them to work collectively to prevent or mitigate negative impacts as much as possible (see references [11] and [12] in the Bibliography). Consultative practices that result in good industrial relations help to provide positive working environments, reduce turnover, and minimize operational disruptions"

                  "answer": "Background\r\nInformation on the creation and distribution of economic value provides a basic indication of how an organization has created wealth for stakeholders. Several components of the economic value generated and distributed (EVG&D) also provide an economic profile of an organization, which can be useful for normalizing other performance figures. If presented in country-level detail, EVG&D can provide a useful picture of the direct monetary\r\nvalue added to local economies.\r\n\r\nGuidance for Disclosure 201-1\r\nRevenues\r\nAn organization can calculate revenues as net sales plus revenues from financial investments and sales of assets.\r\n\r\nNet sales can be calculated as gross sales from products and services minus returns, discounts, and allowances.\r\n\r\nRevenues from financial investments can include cash received as:\r\n• interest on financial loans;\r\n• dividends from shareholdings;\r\n• royalties;\r\n• direct income generated from assets, such as property rental.\r\n\r\nRevenues from sale of assets can include:\r\n•physical assets, such as property, infrastructure, and equipment;\r\n• intangibles, such as intellectual property rights, designs, and brand names.\r\n\r\nOperating costs\r\nAn organization can calculate operating costs as cash payments made outside the organization for materials, product components, facilities, and services purchased.\r\nServices purchased can include payments to self-employed persons, temporary placement agencies and other organizations providing services. Costs related to workers who are not employees working in an operational role are included as part of services purchased, rather than under employee wages and benefits.\r\n\r\nOperating costs can include:\r\n• property rental;\r\n• license fees;\r\n• facilitation payments (since these have a clear commercial objective);\r\n• royalties;\r\n• payments for contract workers;\r\n• training costs, if outside trainers are used;\r\n• personal protective clothing.\r\n\r\nThe use of facilitation payments is also addressed in GRI 205: Anti-corruption 2016.\r\n\r\nEmployee wages and benefits\r\nAn organization can calculate employee wages and benefits as total payroll (including employee salaries and amounts paid to government institutions on behalf of employees) plus total benefits (excluding training, costs of protective equipment or other cost items directly related to the employee’s job function).\r\n\r\nAmounts paid to government institutions on behalf of employees can include employee taxes, levies, and unemployment funds.\r\n\r\nTotal benifits include:\r\n-regular contributions, such as to pensions, insurance, company vehicles, and private health;\r\n-other employee support, such as housing, interest-free loans, public transport assistance, educational grants, and redundancy payments.\r\n\r\nPayments to providers of capital\r\nAn organization can calculate payments to providers of capital as dividends to all shareholders, plus interest payments made to providers of loans.\r\n\r\nIntersts provided for loans include:\r\n• interest on all forms of debt and borrowings (not only long-term debt);\r\n• arrears of dividends due to preferred shareholders.\r\n\r\nPayments to government\r\nAn organization can calculate payments to governments as all of the organization’s taxes plus related penalties paid at the international, national, and local levels. Organization taxes can include corporate, income, and property. Payments to government exclude deferred taxes, because they may not be paid. If operating in more than one country, the organization can report taxes paid by country, including the definition of segmentation used.\r\n\r\nCommunity investments\r\nTotal community investments refers to actual expenditures in the reporting period, not commitments. An organization can calculate community investments as voluntary donations plus investment of funds in the broader community where the target beneficiaries are external to the organization. Voluntary donations and investment of funds in the broader community where the target beneficiaries are external to the organization can include:\r\n• contributions to charities, NGOs and research institutes (unrelated to the organization’s commercial research and development);\r\n• funds to support community infrastructure, such as recreational facilities;\r\n• direct costs of social programs, including arts and educational events. \r\n\r\nIf reporting infrastructure investments, an organization can include costs of goods and labor, in addition to capital costs, as well as operating costs for support of ongoing facilities or programs. An example of support for ongoing facilities or programs can include the organization funding the daily operations of a public facility. Community investments exclude legal and commercial activities or where the purpose of the investment is exclusively commercial (donations to political parties can be included, but are also addressed separately in more detail in GRI 415: Public Policy 2016).\r\n\r\nCommunity investments also exclude any infrastructure investment that is driven primarily by core business needs, or to facilitate the business operations of an organization. Infrastructure investments driven primarily by core business needs can include, for example, building a road to a mine or a factory. The calculation of investment can include infrastructure built outside the main business activities of the organization, such as a school or hospital for workers and their families.\r\n\r\n"

It can include the organization’s tax principles, its attitude to tax planning, the degree of risk the organization is willing to accept, and the organization’s approach to engaging with tax authorities.\r\n\r\nAn organization’s approach to tax is often described in a tax strategy, but it could also be described in equivalent documents, such as policies, standards, principles, or codes of conduct.\r\n \r\nGuidance for Disclosure 207-1-a\r\nThe reporting organization can illustrate its approach to tax by providing examples drawn from its tax practices. For example, the organization can provide an overview of its use of tax havens, the types of tax incentive it uses, or its approach to transfer pricing. These examples help demonstrate the organization’s risk appetite and the tax practices deemed acceptable and unacceptable by the organization and its highest governance body.\r\n\r\nGuidance for Disclosure 207-1-a-i\r\nIf the organization has a tax strategy but the strategy is not publicly available, the organization can provide an abstract or summary of the strategy. If the organization has a tax strategy that applies to a smaller number of entities or tax jurisdictions than reported in Disclosure 207-4, the organization may report this strategy and list the entities or tax jurisdictions to which the strategy applies. In addition to the overall strategy, if the organization has tax strategies that apply to individual entities or tax jurisdictions, the organization can explain any relevant differences between these strategies.\r\n\r\nGuidance for Disclosure 207-1-a-iii\r\nWhen describing its approach to regulatory compliance, the organization can describe any statements in its tax strategy or equivalent documents regarding its intention with respect to the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. For example, the organization can describe whether it seeks to comply with the letter and the spirit of the law. That is, whether the organization takes reasonable steps to determine and follow the intention of the legislature.\r\n\r\nGuidance for Disclosure 207-1-a-iv\r\nWhen describing how its approach to tax is linked to its business strategy, the organization can explain how its tax planning is aligned with its commercial activities. The description can include any relevant statements from its tax strategy or equivalent documents. When describing how its approach to tax is linked to its sustainable development strategy, the organization can explain the following:\r\n\r\n• Whether it considered the economic and social impacts of its approach to tax when developing its tax strategy.\r\n•Any organizational commitments to sustainable development in the jurisdictions in which it\r\noperates and whether its approach to tax is aligned with these commitments"

The organization can also specify any accountability for compliance delegated to executive-level positions within the organization.\r\n\r\nGuidance for Disclosure 207-2-a-ii\r\nWhen reporting how the approach to tax is embedded within the organization, the organization can describe processes, projects, programs, and initiatives that support adherence to the approach to tax and tax strategy.\r\n\r\nGuidance for Disclosure 207-2-a-iii\r\nTax risks are risks associated with the organization’s tax practices that might lead to a negative effect on the goals of the organization, or to financial or reputational damage. These include compliance risks or risks such as those related to uncertain tax positions, changes in legislation, or a perception of aggressive tax practices. When reporting on the approach to tax risks, the organization can describe its risk appetite and tolerance and provide examples of tax practices it has avoided because they are misaligned with its approach to tax and tax strategy. Risk appetite and tolerance indicate the degree of risk the organization is willing to accept in determining its tax positions.\r\n\r\nGuidance for Disclosure 207-2-a-iv\r\nWhen reporting how compliance with the tax governance and control framework is evaluated, the organization can describe the process through which the tax governance and control framework is monitored, tested, and maintained. An example of this is giving an internal auditor accountability for undertaking annual reviews of the tax department’s compliance with the tax governance and control framework. The organization can also specify the degree to which the highest governance body has oversight of the design, implementation, and effectiveness of the tax governance and control framework.\r\n\r\nGuidance for Disclosure 207-2-b\r\nOne example of a mechanism for individuals to raise concerns about the organization’s business conduct, or about activities that compromise the organization’s integrity in relation to tax, is whistleblowing.Disclosure 207-2-b is related to Disclosure 2-26 in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021.

  "entry": "The Governance of State-Owned Enterprises\r\nState-owned enterprises (SOEs) are often at the forefront of the corporate governance discussion precisely due to their ownership. Diverse countries approach state ownership differently. However, the degree of involvement of the state, as controlling shareholder, in strategy setting, oversight, controls and day-to-day operations, remains as a critical governance focus. In 2015, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) updated its Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises to further reinforce that SOEs, and their boards, should be afforded adequate autonomy from the state to appropriately balance commercial and policy objectives and minimize the risk of political influence. As SOEs are important contributors to the economy, their governance frameworks should foster efficiency, transparency and competitiveness. Following these Guidelines, and with the aim of strengthening the analysis of risks stemming from state ownership, IFC has revised its tools for analyzing the corporate governance framework and practices of SOEs.\r\nUsing the SOE CG Tools\r\nThere are eight key Corporate Governance (CG) tools used for analyzing the governance of potential IFC investee companies. The Instruction Sheet, the SOE Progression Matrix, Document and Information Request Lists, and the Corporate Governance Review (CGR) Report Generator have been adapted to the specificities of SOEs. The Model Independent Director Definition, the Sample CGA or Investment Review Memorandum CG Section and “Supervision Checklist”, and the explanatory note “Why Corporate Governance?” are applicable across all six paradigms, without any adaptations.\r\n1) Instruction Sheet—State-Owned Enterprises. The purpose of this Instruction Sheet is to describe each of the key CG Tools, how they should be used, and who should be interviewed for either a Corporate Governance Assessment (CGA) or a Corporate Governance Review (CGR).\r\n2) Why Corporate Governance? This note explains IFC’s approach as a value-add for clients. This explanatory note should be given to the client at the earliest opportunity in the pre-appraisal.\r\n3) Progression Matrix—State-Owned Enterprises. The Progression Matrix relates the six areas of governance (Commitment to Good CG, the Board of Directors, Control Environment, Transparency and Disclosure, Shareholders Rights, and Governance of Stakeholder Engagement) to four levels of achievement. The matrix framework emphasizes the importance of ongoing improvements in the governance practices of clients, rather than trying to apply rigid and static minimum standards. In particular the Progression Matrix allows clients to assess the governance of their own company against a simple framework. The Progression Matrix should be given to the client at the earliest opportunity in the pre-appraisal.\r\n4) Document and Information Request— State-Owned Enterprises. These combined questionnaires support information gathering necessary for a CGA of an IFC client. The Document and Information Request is organized along the same template as the six areas of governance in the Progression Matrix. For a CGA the Document and Information Request should be circulated to the company at least three weeks in advance of the onsite visit. The company should identify a designated officer who will be charged with responding to the Document and Information Request by providing brief written answers of one or two paragraphs to each of the questions and delivering these to IFC prior to the onsite CGA. For the CGR, the investment officer must collect the required information from the documents or from interviews during the appraisal. If the investment officer elects to send a specially prepared CGR document and information request ahead of the site visit, an amended “questions only” version of the Report Generator should be sent to the client. Discussions relevant to IFC’s understanding of the governance of a company will arise throughout the appraisal and diligence process. Therefore, IFC Investment staff are encouraged to edit the document and information requests as necessary before sending it to the client to avoid duplication.\r\n5) Corporate Governance Report Generator: This document is intended for use by Investment Officers (and CG Officers, in the case of detailed reviews) in conducting a CGR; preparing the corporate governance section of an Investment Review Memorandum; responding to questions from Director at the Investment Review Meeting; and in presenting any major issues to the IFC Board. The Corporate Governance Report Generator uses negative assertions to introduce each area of risk, then utilizes rhetorical questions to frame the risk issue and identify and assess relevant practices and procedures. The aim is to help Investment Officers determine how much the SOE mitigates the risk. The Investment Officer is required to collect information about the SOE and report in the Decision Book CG section. The CG Report Generator aids Investment Officers in preparing this CG section as it indicates the data that must be collected from the client while providing guidance on how to collect this information by interviewing individuals at or contracted by the SOE, or by reviewing a specific legal document.\r\n6) Model Independent Director Definition. Perhaps the most frequent governance recommendation is to increase the board’s independence from both the management and the controlling shareholders. However, to achieve genuine board independence, it is crucial to carefully define what it means for directors to be “independent.” This Model Inde pendent Director Definition is often used during discussions with the client to clarify the assessment of the current board and its future needs.\r\n7) Sample CGA or CG Section (for CGRs) in Investment Review Memorandum: The CGA and CGR always generate a written section for the Investment Review Memorandum and sometimes this will include recommendations for improvements to be undertaken by the fund. The sample CGR Section provides a useful reference point for the Investment Officer’s use, and a sample CGA provides a useful example for a CG Officer.\r\n8) Supervision Checklist. The Supervision Checklist provides a list of key issues that should be considered by Investment staff while supervising IFC investee companies and especially those companies undertaking CGIPs.\r\nCorporate Governance Interviewees\r\nTo carry out a thorough a corporate governance analysis (CGA or CGR), IFC staff need to engage in direct discussions with those who play a variety of governance roles in the SOE. Following is a list of the people who would typically be interviewed. However, companies may differ significantly in how they apportion responsibilities in the titles that they use for various SOE positions, so it is critical that IFC staff meet with those who, as a practical matter, are responsible for the principal corporate governance functions, regardless of their job titles.\r\n1. Representatives of controlling shareholders\r\n2. Representatives of other holders of significant blocks of shares\r\n3. Chair and members of the board of directors, including any state nominee directors, \"independent\" board members and the chairs of the audit and other special committees of the board (and where applicable, members of the inspection committee: the fiscal board, commisaire, audit commission, comisario or revisor fiscal)\r\n4. Chief executive officer\r\n5. Chief financial officer (or senior accounting officer)\r\n6. General counsel (or senior lawyer)\r\n7. Corporate secretary\r\n8. Chief internal auditor\r\n9. Chief risk officer\r\n10. Chief of investor relations\r\n11. Independent external auditors and/or state auditor\r\n12. Sustainability officer",

  "entry": "The economic and regulatory environment for funds has evolved significantly since the 2008 financial crisis and exposed IFC, one of the largest emerging markets fund investors, to new governance risks. IFC’s Corporate Governance Group seeks to assess and improve fund governance, and thereby strengthen operational foundations and reduce risks of its investment into fund vehicles.\r\nEffective funds require a strong alignment of interest between the general partner and limited partner(s); management of the investment vehicle by a capable execution team based on sound strategy; adequate risk and control mechanisms; and appropriate transparency and disclosure of information by the fund partnership members. Through contractual and procedural modalities that integrate governance principles into fund management and investment operations, funds can add significant commercial value to their portfolio investment companies. Sound governance also helps attract investor interest into the fund, lead to better fiduciary management of the fund’s assets, and enable higher returns for investors from improved portfolio results. IFC’s experience has shown that there is a strong relationship between fund performance and development impact. Furthermore, strong governance contributes to the growth and long- term sustainability of private equity investment flows into emerging markets.\r\nUsing the Fund Governance Tools:\r\nThere are eight key tools that are used for analysing the governance of funds. The Instruction Sheet, Fund Progression Matrix, Document and Information Request List, and the Fund Governance\r\nReport Generator for funds have been adapted for the Fund Governance Paradigm. The explanatory note ‘Why Corporate Governance?’ Sample CGA or Investment Review Memorandum CG Section and Supervision Checklist are applicable across all CG paradigms.\r\nThe primary fund model contemplated for analysis is a limited partnership and the relationships be- tween the limited partners and the general partner or fund manager. If the fund under consideration is an L.L.C., listed entity or other corporate structure, please incorporate the requisite paradigm, e.g., listed companies, family or founder-owned, or financial institutions, etc. For analysis of the governance of the fund’s target or portfolio investee companies, refer to the relevant CG paradigm, such as the SME governance paradigm and supporting materials.\r\n1) Instruction Sheet: The purpose of this Instruction Sheet is to describe each of the key fund governance tools, how they should be used and who should be interviewed for a Fund Governance Assessment (FGA) or a Fund Governance Review (FGR).\r\n2) Why is Corporate Governance Important? This note explains the rationale for sound corporate governance, and IFC’s approach for value addition to its clients. This explanatory note should be given to the client at the earliest opportunity during the pre-appraisal stage to explain the broader context of IFC’s review of fund governance.\r\n3) Progression Matrix: The Progression Matrix relates the six areas of fund governance (commitment to fund and investee company governance; structure and functioning of governing bodies – fund manager or general partner, limited partner advisory committee, investment committee; control environment; transparency and disclosure; treatment of limited partners, asset owners and investors; and governance of stakeholder engagement) to four levels of achievement. The use of a matrix emphasizes the importance of ongoing improvements in the governance practices of fund clients, rather than trying to apply rigid and static mini- mum standards. Moreover, the Progression Matrix allows the fund to assess its own governance against a simple framework. This document should be given to the client at the earliest opportunity in the appraisal process.\r\n4) Document & Information Request List: These combined questionnaires support information gathering necessary for the fund governance review. The Document and Information Request List is organized along the same lines as the six areas of governance in the Progression Matrix. For an FGA, the combined Document and Information Request List should be circulated to the fund at least three weeks in advance of the on-site visit. The fund should identify a single officer who will be charged with responding to the Document and Information Request List by providing brief written answers of one or two paragraphs to each of the questions and deliver these to IFC prior to the on-site fund governance analysis. For the FGR, the Investment Officer must collect the required information from the documents or from interviews during the appraisal. If the Investment Officer elects to send a specially prepared information request ahead of the site visit, an amended ‘questions-only’ version of the Fund IFC Fund Governance Assessment Progression Matrix for Funds Instruction Sheet 3Governance Report Generator (see below) can be sent to the client. Discussions relevant to IFC’s understanding of the governance of the institution will arise throughout the appraisal and diligence process. IFC staff are encouraged to edit the information request as necessary before sending it to the client to avoid duplication.\r\n5) Fund Governance Report Generator: This document is intended for use by Investment Officers (and CG Officers, in the case of detailed reviews) in conducting an FGR; preparing the fund governance section of an Investment Review Memorandum; responding to questions from Director at the Investment Review Meeting; and in presenting any major issues to the IFC Board. The Fund Gover- nance Report Generator uses negative assertions to introduce each area of risk, then utilizes rhetorical questions to frame the risk issue and identify and assess relevant fund practices and procedures. The aim is to help Investment Officers determine how much the fund mitigates the risk. The Investment Officer is required to collect information about the fund and report in the Decision Book FG section. The Fund Governance Review Report Generator Aids Investment Officers in preparing this FG section as it indicates the data that must be collected from the client while providing guidance on how to collect this information by interviewing individuals at or contracted by the fund, or by reviewing a specific legal document.\r\n6) Sample FGA or FG Section (for FGRs) in Investment Review Memorandum: The FGA and FGR always generate a written section for the Investment Review Memorandum and sometimes this will include recommendations for improvements to be undertaken by the fund. The sample FGR Section provides a useful reference point for the Investment Officer’s use, and a sample FGA provides a useful example for a CG Officer.\r\n7) Sample FG Improvement Programs or Sample Decision Book Section (for FGRs). Sometimes, an FGA results in the need for the client to develop and implement a Fund Governance Improvement Program (FGIP). The FGIP should always be tailored to the circumstances and priorities of the fund. However, sample FGIPs give a good idea of what has been negotiated with clients in the past; therefore, they can be used as a reference point in the drafting process. The FGR always generates a section for the Decision Book, and sometimes this will include recommendations for improvements. The Sample FGR Decision Book Section provides a useful reference point for the Investment Officer’s use.\r\n8) Supervision Checklist: The Supervision Checklist provides a list of key issues that should be considered by investment staff while supervising IFC projects and, in particular, those implementing fund governance conditionalities.\r\nFund Governance Interviewees:\r\nTo carry out a thorough FGR or FGA, those conducting the governance analysis should have direct discussions with people who play a variety of governance roles in the fund. A guiding list of potential interviewees is provided below. However, funds differ significantly in how they apportion responsibilities and in the titles that they use for different positions, so it is important that Investment Officers or CG Officers, as applicable, meet with those who, as a practical matter, are responsible for the principal governance functions, irrespective of their job titles.\r\n1. Fund manager\r\n2. Key limited partners / investors\r\n3. Minority limited partners / investors\r\n4. Investment committee chair\r\n5. Limited partner advisory committee chair 6. Chief executive officer (or equivalent\r\nposition)\r\n7. Fund secretary (or equivalent position) 8. Chief financial officer (or senior\r\naccounting officer)\r\n9.

  "entry": "The Governance of Family-owned or Founder-owned Unlisted Companies\r\nFamily or founder-owned unlisted companies are the most common type of company in almost all IFC’s client countries. Family or founder-owned unlisted companies are defined as companies in which the founders or the founders’ families have either com- plete ownership or effective control of the company and, usually, a significant role in company manage- ment. Family companies are particularly predom- inant among medium and small companies, but in many markets even most large companies have a family as their controlling shareholder. The complex interaction of the family and the company that it controls creates additional governance challenges to those faced by other companies, including: succes- sion planning for the family management; family versus non-family employment and promotion; equitable treatment of non-family shareholders; and the role of family meetings vis-à-vis Board meetings and shareholders meetings. The primary focus of IFC’s family company paradigm is on unlisted family companies. However, many of IFC’s largest investee companies are listed companies with a family as the controlling shareholder. For these clients, the family-company paradigm should be used in tandem with the listed-company paradigm.\r\nUsing the CG Tools\r\nEight key corporate governance (CG) tools are used for analyzing the governance of potential IFC investee companies. The Instruction Sheets, Progression Matrixes, Document and Information\r\n \r\nRequest Lists, the Corporate Governance Review Report Generator and the Sample CG Improvement Programs have been adapted for the Family Com- pany Paradigm, the Model Independent Director Definition, the Supervision Checklist, Sample CG Improvement Programs or Sample Decision Book Section and the explanatory note “Why Corporate Governance?” are applicable across all six para- digms, without any adaptations.\r\n\r\n1)\tInstruction Sheet—Family Companies. The purpose of this Instruction Sheet is to describe each of the key CG tools, how they should be used, and who should be interviewed in the course of either a Corporate Governance Assessment or a Corporate Governance Review.\r\n\r\n2)\tWhy is Corporate Governance Important? This note explains IFC’s approach as value-added for clients. This explanatory note should be given to the client at the earliest opportunity in the pre-appraisal.\r\n\r\n3)\tProgression Matrix—Family Companies. The Progression Matrix relates six areas of governance (Commitment to Good CG, the Board of Directors, Control Environment, Transparency and Disclosure, Shareholders Rights and Governance of Stakehold- er Engagement to four levels of achievement. The matrix framework emphasizes the importance of ongoing improvements in the governance practices of clients, rather than trying to apply rigid mini- mum standards. In particular, the Progression Matrix allows clients to assess the governance of their own company against a simple framework. The Progression Matrix should be given to the client at the earliest opportunity in the pre-appraisal.\r\n\r\n4)\tDocument & Information Request List— Family Companies. This list of questions and requests for documentation establishes the basis for the Corporate Governance Assessment (CGA) of an IFC client. The Document and Information Request List is organized along the same lines as the six areas of governance in the Progression Matrix. For a CGA, The Document and Informa- tion Request List should be circulated to the company at least three weeks in advance of the onsite visit. The company should identify a single officer who will be charged with responding to The Document and Information Request List by providing brief written answers of one or two paragraphs to each of the questions and deliver- ing these to IFC prior to the onsite CGA. For the Corporate Governance Review (CGR), the invest- ment officer must collect the required information from the documents or from interviews during the appraisal. If the investment officer elects to send a specially prepared CGR Document and Informa- tion Request List ahead of the site visit, an amended “questions only” version of the CGR Report Generator should be sent to the client. Discussions relevant to IFC’s understanding of the governance of a company will arise throughout the appraisal and diligence process. Therefore, IFC Investment staff are encouraged to edit The Document and Information Request List (CGA or CGR) as necessary before sending them to the client, to avoid duplication.\r\n 5)\tCorporate Governance Review Report Generator: This document is intended for use by Investment Officers (and CG Officers, in the case of detailed reviews) in conducting a CGR;\r\npreparing the corporate governance section of an Investment Review Memorandum; responding to questions from Director at the Investment Review Meeting; and in presenting any major issues to the IFC Board. The CGR Report Generator uses negative assertions on each area of risk, and then\r\nusing questions to frame the risk issue and identify and assess relevant company practices and proce- dures, helps Investment Officers to determine the level to which the company mitigates the risk. The Investment Officer is required to collect informa- tion about the company and report in the Decision Book CG section which features are displayed by the client and which are not. The CGR Report Generator aids Investment Officers in preparing this CG section as it indicates the data that must be collected from the client and provides guidance on how to collect this information by interviewing individuals at or contracted by the company, or by reviewing a specific legal document.\r\n6)\tModel Independent Director Definition. Perhaps the most common governance recommendation\r\nis to increase the board’s independence from both the management and the controlling shareholders. However, to achieve genuine board independence, it is crucial to carefully define what it means for directors to be “independent.” This Model Inde- pendent Director Definition is often used during\r\n \r\ndiscussions with the client to clarify the assessment of the current board and its future needs.\r\n7)\tSample CG Improvement Programs or\r\nSample Decision Book Section (for CGRs). Some- times, a CGA results in the need for the client to develop and implement a Corporate Governance Improvement Program (CGIP). The CGIP should always be tailored to the circumstances and pri- orities of the company. However, sample CGIPs give a good idea of what has been negotiated with clients in the past; therefore, they can be used as a reference point in the drafting process. The Corpo- rate Governance Review (CGR) always generates a section for the Decision Book, and sometimes this will include recommendations for improvements.\r\n8)\tSupervision Checklist. The Supervision Checklist provides a list of key issues that Investment staff should consider while supervising IFC investee companies and, in particular, those companies undertaking CGIPs.\r\n\r\nCorporate Governance Interviewees\r\nTo carry out a thorough corporate governance analysis (CGA or CGR), IFC staff need to have direct discussions with people who play a variety of governance roles in the company. Following is a list of the people who would typically be interviewed. However, companies may differ significantly in how they apportion responsibilities and in the corporate titles they use for different positions in the company, so it is important that IFC staff meet with those who, as a practical matter, are responsi- ble for the principal corporate governance func- tions, regardless of their job titles.\r\n1.\tRepresentatives of controlling shareholders\r\n2.\tRepresentatives of other holders of significant blocks of shares\r\n3.\tFormal or informal advisors to the owners and managers of the company, including Advisory Board Members, if applicable\r\n4.\tChair and members of the board of directors, including any “independent” board members, outside or non-family members of the Board of Directors and the chairs of the audit and other special committees of the board (and where applicable, members of the inspection committee: the fiscal board, commisaire, audit commission, comisario, or revisor fiscal)\r\n5.\tChief executive officer\r\n6.\tChief financial officer (or senior accounting officer)\r\n7.\tGeneral counsel (or senior lawyer)\r\n8.\tCorporate secretary\r\n9.\tChief of internal audit and internal controls, if applicable\r\n10.\tChief of investor relations\r\n11.\tIndependent external auditors\r\n12.\tSustainability officer",

Provide a definition of materiality consistent with national regulations.\r\n•\tFinancial Impacts: Encourage respondents to quantify the financial impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities whenever possible. This includes providing estimates of potential revenue changes, cost impacts, and asset impairments or write-offs.\r\n•\tForward-Looking Information: Highlight the importance of providing forward-looking information, including scenario analysis and targets, to help investors understand the organization's future resilience.\r\n•\tDisclosure Location: Specify that climate-related financial disclosures should ideally be included in mainstream financial filings (e.g., annual reports). If this is not possible due to national disclosure requirements, the information should be disclosed in other official company reports subject to similar governance processes.\r\n•\tInterconnectedness: All four TCFD themes should be viewed as interconnected and should be answered while keeping this in mind.\r\n•\tDisclosure evolution: Disclosures should improve over time as climate-related practices evolve.\r\n\r\nTHEME-SPECIFIC DETAILS:\r\n1. Governance:\r\n•\tBoard Oversight Structure: Explain the structure the board uses to oversee climate-related challenges, including whether committees are allocated to this task.\r\n•\tManagement Accountability: Detail how management is incentivized to achieve targets related to climate change.\r\n2. Strategy:\r\n•\tScenario Analysis Guidance: Explain how risks and opportunities are assessed, including the timescales.\r\n•\tBusiness Impact Details: Describe where climate changes are most likely to impact the business: for example, product innovation or in the supply chain.\r\n3. Risk Management:\r\n•\tRisk Assessment Processes: The processes that are in place for assessing and prioritizing risks should be well documented.\r\n•\tRisk Integration Examples: Provide suggestions for including risks into an overall management framework.\r\n4. Metrics and Targets:\r\n•\tMetrics Definition: Where possible, metrics should be specific to the organization and easily understandable.\r\n•\tEmissions Boundaries: Clarify the boundaries for Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions reporting, including which activities and sources are included. If Scope 3 emissions are not disclosed, provide a justification for their exclusion.\r\n•\tTarget Types: Distinguish between absolute emissions reduction targets, intensity-based targets, and other types of climate-related targets.\r\n•\tBase Years: Specify the base year used for setting targets and the rationale for selecting that year.\r\n•\tProgress Reporting: Describe how progress towards targets is monitored and reported, including the frequency of reporting and the methodologies used.",
